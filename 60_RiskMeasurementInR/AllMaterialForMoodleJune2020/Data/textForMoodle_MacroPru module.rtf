\f0\fs24 \cf0 TEXT for Moodle\
\
My intention when starting to write the code for this module was to cover means, variances, covariances, histograms, fitted Normal curves and Value at Risk. But then I decided that I should include something about what risk is, how it's related to variance and how economists analyse risk aversion. And then I thought that something on the way that risk can be reduced by combining risky positions in a portfolio might be interesting too. So...that's why there are three coding sessions in this module. If you are pressed for time I suggest that you work through just the `core' session, Topic 9.2 Risk Measurement; this is the only one that you will have been expected to have covered by the end of the FY. The others are  just for interest really; Topic 9.1 Risk Aversion sets the scene a bit, and Topic 9.3 Portfolio Analysis (which is very short) ... You may prefer to wait for the video versions of these...\
