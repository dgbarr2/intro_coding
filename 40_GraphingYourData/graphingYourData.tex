\section{Setting up.}
\begin{itemize}
	\item We shall work throught the file \textcolor{red}{FY\_MPol\_graphData.R} which you should copy to your /courseCode folder.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item This will appear as \textcolor{red}{ImportingData\_CSVfiles} in  /courseCode i.e. Windows doesn't show the `.R' extension.
		\item Check in the `Type' column of the folders file list to be sure you have the correct file - it should read `R file'.
	\end{itemize}
	\item Copy the file from your  /courseCode to folder  /myCodeAndData and rename it `myFY\_MPol\_graphData.R'.
\newpage
	\item The data we will work with are in the file \textcolor{red}{FY\_MPol\_Data.csv} which you should copy into your /courseData folder where it  will appear as \textcolor{red}{FY\_MPol\_Data} i.e. Windows will not show the .csv extension. Copy this file to  /myCodeAndData (no need to rename this one).
	\newpage
\item Then...
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Start R studio.
	\item Set your working directory with
	\begin{lstlisting}
setwd("C:/Users/[your number]/Documents/FY_Rcourse/myCodeAndData")
\end{lstlisting}
as explained in the `5. Setting your working directory' slides.
\item Either:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Create a new file in R Studio (call it whatever you like) then type (or copy and paste if you're feeling lazy)  the lines from these slides 1 at a time as you read through the text. Or...
	\newpage
	\item Open your file `myFY\_MPol\_Data' (File $>$ Open File) and execute the lines 1 by 1 (with ctrl + enter) as you read through the text. 
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}


\section{Installing some packages.}
\label{section:installGgplot}
\begin{itemize}
	\item The basic version of R can do a lot of the things that we would want to do in the Bank but there are some add-ons that can do these things better. Something called `ggplot' can produce much better graphs than the basic R can.
	\item We have to install these add-ons, called `packages'. We do this just once and they go into the computer's memory just as R Studio does.
	\item The instruction to install ggplot is:
\begin{lstlisting}
install.packages("ggplot2'')
\end{lstlisting}
	\item Copy this instruction and paste it next to the blue \textcolor{blue}{$>$}  in the Console  of R Studio and hit $<$enter$>$.
	\item R will then perform the installation, this may take several minutes and you'll see a lot of text appear intermittently in the console while it is doing it.
	\item When the  \textcolor{blue}{$>$} reappears you can move to the next section of these notes.
\end{itemize}

\section{Start with some notes, then import the data.}
\begin{itemize}
		\item First we see the introductory notes that identify the program and explain what it does.
\begin{lstlisting}
#
# FY_MPol_graphData.R
#
# Import data from a csv file and 
# use it to draw some graphs with ggplot.
#
# DGB Mar 2020
#
\end{lstlisting}
\newpage
	\item Then we have some more notes, this time telling us about the data. 
\begin{lstlisting}
#  We import the following US data series
#  from the file FY_MPol_Data.csv:
#
#  Money supply (narrow) m1  
#  Money supply (broad) m3
#  Prices, p: consumer price index
#  Short rate(1), rs: 3-month T Bill rate
#  Short rate(2), rff: Fed Funds rate
#  Long rates, rl: 10-year interest rate (yield on 10-year gov bonds)
#  Output, y: Industrial production
#  Unemployment, u: Unemployment rate
#
\end{lstlisting}
\newpage
\item Now we have the first line of R code, with a note explaining what it does. While you are learning R it is a good idea to include this line at the start of all your programs.
\begin{lstlisting}
rm(list = ls())  
               # This line clears R's memory of data so
               # that we start from a clean slate for this
               # program with nothing hanging around
               # from any programs we ran earlier.
\end{lstlisting}

	\item Now we import the data as in the previous session. This time we are using genuine data instead of the toy stuff we used before. 
\begin{lstlisting}
#
# Import the data into a data frame, which we will call mpdata.
#

mpdata <- read.csv("FY_MPol_Data.csv", header=TRUE)
\end{lstlisting}

	\item Have a look at what we've imported,  just to check that we have what we expected.
\begin{lstlisting}	
mpdata[1,]  # Print the first line of the data (plus the header)
				  # to the console.
\end{lstlisting}
\lstinputlisting[language=R, backgroundcolor=\color{lightgray}]{firstLineOfData.out}

\newpage
	\item R will print the first 6 lines of the data with the `head()' command...
\begin{lstlisting}
head(mpdata)  # This prints the first 6 lines (plus the header).
\end{lstlisting}
\lstinputlisting[language=R, backgroundcolor=\color{lightgray}]{headOfData.out}

\newpage
	\item Similarly for the final 6 lines using `tail()'
\begin{lstlisting}
tail(mpdata)  # And this prints the final 6 lines (plus the header).
\end{lstlisting}
\lstinputlisting[language=R, backgroundcolor=\color{lightgray}]{tailOfData.out}

\newpage
	\item Now that we have the data we start a new part of the code with a comment about what we are going to do. 
	\begin{lstlisting}
# --------------- Plot (1) p and m1, (2) The 3 interest rates
\end{lstlisting}
\newpage
\item There are several ways to plot data in R. One of the best is by using the package ggplot. In the next line we tell R that we want to use ggplot with this program using the library() command. (If you get a message in the console saying that it can't find ggplot go back to Section \ref{section:installGgplot}.)


\begin{lstlisting} 
# Load ggplot from the library of packages on this laptop. 
library("ggplot2")
\end{lstlisting}

\newpage
	\item Next we have to do something that looks a little odd. R has a built in set of code that handles dates really well but we have to tell it that, for example, `1960-01-01' is actually a date and not just a string of numbers and dashes. We do this with the following line which makes R treat the  `date' column of mpdata as dates. (The data frame, mpdata, will look the same after this line is executed as it did before.)

\begin{lstlisting}	 
# Tell R to treat the `date' column as dates.
mpdata[["date"]] <- as.Date(mpdata[["date"]])  
\end{lstlisting}


\newpage
	\item Now, at last, we tell R to create a graph.
\begin{lstlisting}
ggplot(mpdata, aes(date)) + geom_line(aes(y=m1),colour="red") +
                            geom_line(aes(y=p*10),colour="blue")
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Explaining what all this means would take some time so it's best to just accept that this line does the trick.
	\item The first part tells R to use ggplot, and to get the data from our data frame `mpdata'. 
	\item The `aes(date)' tells it what to put on the horizontal axis i.e. the `date' column from mpdata.
	\item Then we get the code to draw the first line, which has y values equal to m1, and will be drawn in red.
	\newpage
	\item Finally we add a second line, with y values equal to $p \times 10$, written `p*10' (the $\times 10$ is just to scale up the values so that they look better in the graph when plotted next to the m1 values), and this one will be blue.
\end{itemize}	
	\item And this is what we get: (It will appear in the bottom right window of R Studio if all is well.)
	\begin{figure}[H]  % --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  			\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{mpdataPlot_1.pdf}
  			\caption{Output from ggplot of m1 and p*10.}
  			\label{fig:mpdataPlot_1}
  			\end{center}
	\end{figure}         % --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	\item The next line plots the 3 interest rates in mpdata.
	\begin{lstlisting}
ggplot(mpdata, aes(date)) + geom_line(aes(y=rs),colour="red") + 
                            geom_line(aes(y=rl),colour="blue") +
                            geom_line(aes(y=rff),colour="green")
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{figure}[H]  % --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
			\begin{center}
  			\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{mpdataPlot_2.pdf}
  			\caption{Output from ggplot of 3 interest rates.}
  			\label{fig:mpdataPlot_1}
  			\end{center}
	\end{figure}         % --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	\item Finally, we take control of the start and end dates of the graph.
\begin{lstlisting}	
# Plot a sub period 
# (see https://www.neonscience.org/dc-time-series-plot-ggplot-r):

startPlot <- as.Date("2011-01-01")
endPlot <- as.Date("2019-01-01")

plotDates <- c(startPlot, endPlot)
plotDates

\end{lstlisting}
\begin{itemize}
	\item The first two lines create 2 variables, which we choose to call startPlot and endPlot: they take a string of characters the {\em we} recognise as a date (2011-01-01) and tell R to treat it as a date too (just as we did earlier for the `date' column in mpdata).
	\item We then combine these in a single variable called plotDates (our choice of name again) - ggplot has to be given both dates inside a single variable (it's just one of ggplot's rules).
\end{itemize}
\item Now we can get ggplot going again but this time we add\\  `(scale\_x\_date(limits=plotDates))' to give it the info about the start and end dates.
\begin{lstlisting}
ggplot(mpdata, aes(date)) + geom_line(aes(y=m1),colour="red") + 
                          geom_line(aes(y=p*10),colour="blue") + 
                          (scale_x_date(limits=plotDates))
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{figure}[H]  % --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
			\begin{center}
  			\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{mpdataPlot_3.pdf}
  			\caption{Short sample output from ggplot of m1 and p*10.}
  			\label{fig:mpdataPlot_1}
  			\end{center}
\end{figure}         % --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\end{itemize}

\section{Finding your plots.}
\begin{itemize}
	\item You should now have 3 plots but you can only see one of the.
	\item To see the others click on the back and forward arrows on the `Plots' pane.
